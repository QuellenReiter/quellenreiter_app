## Base Project
This application belongs to the [QuellenReiter:in project](quellenreiter.app) created and implemented by Simon Sasse and Jannik Werner. The project consists of a "Fake News" database which is openly accesible through this frontend. In addition, a "Fake News" Quiz App derives its quests from the database.

### Aim üèπ
Our aim is to tackle the issue of misinformation (in Germany) with a playful approach and open-data.

## Functionality ü¶æ

## Implementation üñ•Ô∏è
The application is implemented using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and [Dart](https://dart.dev). Flutter is an open-source and cross-plattform app framework created by Google. Furthermore, [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) is used to query and mutate the database which is a [Parse Server](https://parseplatform.org) hosted on [Back4App](https://www.back4app.com). All these projects are open-source themselves.

## Installation 
**!! This code is only usable with a working Flutter installation !!**<br>
Note: If you have never used Flutter, consider its [documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev)
1. Follow install instructions for [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
2. `git clone https://github.com/QuellenReiter/quellenreiter_app.git`
3. Open the project in your text editor or IDE and run `flutter doctor` to check if everything works fine.
4. To run the application use `flutter run -d [ios, android]`.
